Testing is the most straight forward answer to ensure quality, security, incorporating user needs, & designing effective programs. In order to create funtional & secure software, I needed to follow best practices such as attempting to write clear & well-documented code. Sometimes the code would exhibit some unexpected behaviors, due to an errant letter, or spacing in my code. When the tests fail, learning to work backwards & try to address the root cause inside of disabling them helps. 

When I interpret user needs and translate them into software features, I rely on thorough research and clear communication. I engage with stakeholders through interviews, surveys, and direct observation to understand their real-world requirements. By gathering these insights, I can structure them into user stories and prioritize them based on their importance. This approach ensures that I focus on delivering the most valuable features first.

When designing software, I approach the process with curiosity and an open mind. Engaging stakeholders with thoughtful questions helps clarify their vision and requirements. Since clients may not have a fully defined idea initially, effective elicitation is crucial to explore and refine their needs. I prioritize understanding the problem thoroughly before moving to solutions, as this ensures the design aligns with both user expectations and business goals.
